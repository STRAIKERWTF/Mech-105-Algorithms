# Simpson Algorithm Files
### This MatLab algorithm uses the inputs *x, y* to numerically evaluate the integral of the vector of function values ‘y’ with respect to ‘x’ and outputs that to *I* 
##### This algorithm grossly overestimates when an odd number of intervals are used. When even intervals are used it is 100% accurate.
